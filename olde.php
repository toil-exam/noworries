<h1>The Olde Testament</h1>
<p>THE FOLLOWING IS THE MOTHER FUCKING TRUTH ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN BIBLICAL TIMES.</p>

<p>So you know that huge meteor thing that killed all the dinos? Nah. That was Satan smokin' up with his dino peeps (you know how they like rollin them bones and whatnot), and he accidentally set his whole fucking field on fire. Bitch was like "shiiit! I'm too high for this shit!" and all the dinosaurs died off because all their weed was destroyed.</p>

<p>Then this God fellow came along and was like "shit. I need some people." popped that bitch Adam out. And the snake in the garden was all "sell dese apples, get money." and Adam was like "shit! mo' money, mo' problems!" and God rolled up and was like "check your balance!".</p>

<p>Then one day God was like "shit. I'm out of papers! Adam, you got any papers?" and Adam was like "naw." but then God was like "shit. gimme your rib. I'ma roll a bone for you. good thing them neanderthals already learned how to use lighters." and after that bone was done, they dropped that shit on the ground and Eve popped up and was all with the makin' samwiches and makin' them munchies.</p>

<p>One day Adam was all chillin on his cloud, and God was like "shit, Adam. you always bummin off my shit. you got anything?" and was all reaching out to him and Adam was reaching out to him and was all like "help! help!" and God was like "shit, son. you pass dat blunt over here, and I'll see what I can do" and Adam was all "hell nah! I ain't passin that shit" and God was like "hell naw!" and then Adam and Eve went on down to earth. I dunno what Eve did to warrant gettin whatever she had coming to her, but I'm sure it was something serious.</p>

<p>ADAM WAS THROWN OUT OF PARADISE FOR BREAKING THE THIRD RULE OF SMOKING. He was holdin, and he was holdin out.</p>

<p>So, Adam and Eve were chillin on earth, makin babies and whatnot, making all sorts of countries, like Israelistan... And DerkaDerkastan. Lived in the deserts and everything. It was pretty chill. Unfortunatly, since God threw them out of paradise and Satan was still sleeping off his eternal blaze, the only ganja these kids still had was what was left in that last blunt. Sufficed to say, that shit didn't last long. It made living in the desert a lot fucking worse.</p>

<p>A whole bunch of other shit happened, and at some point down the line there was this dude, Moses. He was up, chillin in the mountains, and God was like "dude, I'm sorry about all that shit that went down, I'ma gonna share this shit with you" and lit up a bush for him. And Moses was all "fuck yes, dude! I'll do whatever you want if I can take this shit back to my people" and God was all "word. this is what I'm gonna do for you. I'm gonna cook up like, fifteen fucking rules for you to take back to your people and govern them with. The first ten, I dunno, some bullshit about what you've been doing, you know, common sense, but the last five are gonna be about what you guys should do with this shit, ai'ght?"</p>

<p>So God wrote all that shit down on a tablet, and smoked Moses up one last time before sending him back down the mountain. Moses was all rollin down the mountain, chillin and reading all the shit that God had written down for him, admiring all the "thou"s and "thy"s that he included (very stylish), when he came across this old hermit selling some fat ass sub sandwiches. Moses, being the high, broke ass shepherd he was, decided to knife a bitch for a sandwich. IN THE PROCESS OF PULLING OUT HIS KNIFE, however, he dropped the third slate. Commandments 11-15, which were all about like, the most profound things about smoking weed, were lost to time, and Moses's high ass memory. He managed to remember 11-13, which have been passed down through the ages, which are as follows:</p>

<p><b>
Commandment 11: IF IT IS THY GREEN, THOU GET GREEN.<br/>
Commandment 12: PUFF, PUFF, PASS.<br/>
Commandment 13: BE GENEROUS. (WHICH IS THAT ONE THAT THAT DUMB ASS ADAM FUCKED UP)
</b></p>

<p>Moses claimed that commandment 14 had something to do with turning a sheep into a bong, but historians are pretty sure that's total b.s. as it never worked for anyone but Moses.</p>
