<h1>The New Testament</h1>
<p>Anyway, a Testament later, after Moses's's people had been wandering around in the desert trying to find an oasis to plant the finest of greenery, this kid Jesus got born. There were all cherubs and shit floatin' round trying to act cool, wise men with weird ass drugs they were trying to sell (gold, frankensense, and murr; little known fact, these are the basic building blocks to form meth), and all horses and shit chillin in the manger and Mary and whatshisface were all looking for a place to stay, and everyone's all "nah, fuck that shit, we've got a big group coming in later, sorry dude, you know how it is, any other day of the week'd be one thing, but you know saturday's our busy day" and so they were all fuck this shit and just rolled up to a manger for one last tumble in the hay before the kid popped out.</p>

<p>But then, you know, cherubs, dealers, and horses and shit all rolled up and were like "so, I hear you're having a kid" and all trying to push meth on them and whatnot (like they could buy that shit, they couldn't even afford a fucking motel room to play beer pong in), and the wise men were like "fine, whatever, first time's on us" and they took that shit and fed it to the horse. Horse went fucking crazy. Whatever.</p>

<p>So anyway, this kid Jesus rolled up one day, all fully grown and shit, and found the secret field of marihuana (keep in mind this was back before they put a j in marijuana) in Kansas. He came back and was all like "dude. check this shit out. WATER FROM WINE" and everyone was like "daaaaaamn". Then later he was all "dude. this bread is like... MY BODY. all broken for you and shit. Hold on, lemme cut a slice for myself and then you fuckers can have the rest, damn moochers." and a little later he was all "DAMN cottonmouth's a BITCH. FUCK BITCHES. Aight, here, this wine is like... MY BLOOD. I spill this shit for you fuckers. HOLD ON LET ME GET A SIP, SHIT." and he passed that shit around, making sure everyone followed the time honored tradition of puff, puff, pass. His friend John tried to bust out some bong he'd made from a sheep, but Jesus knew a fucking prank when he saw one.</p>

<p>Anyway, so that dude was out chillin and some fuckers randomly kissed him and threw him up on a cross. Which I mean, fair's fair. Good view. He called to his disciple, Peter, and was all like "Peter, come to me, you are my last and only friend, pass me that blunt and get your ass up here, I got one last piece of wisdom to depart on your before departing this moral world." so Peter rolls him up one last, fat ass mother fucking blunt, lit that shit and brought it up to Jesus, just like he asked (what are friend for? when you hanging on a cross, you better have at least one friend to light you up a blunt and workshop that shit for you) and after Jesus had taken his last toke, he wispered in Peter's ear "... I can see your house from here."</p>

<p>Couple days after he died, he rolled up out of his grave with a couple fresh Dutchies and smoked everyone up. Floated up over some mountains and shit and floated back up to heaven. Up there he rolled some fat ass blunts with him holmes God and that Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Anyway, about the time with all this commotion on earth, Satan finnally woke up from his eternal blaze (okay, I guess it wasn't eternal if he woke up from it). So he woke up and was all "shit! what happened to my crib? all these dead people chilling here, like they own the place?" Thankfully his minons kept up with the place (you know them demon things? yeah, those are just the dinosaurs that got all burnt up when Satan's fields caught fire but were still sober enough to look for someplace to chill the fuck out), and so Satan had a pretty cool place to chill. I mean, if you pulled a Rip Van Winkle, and you woke up and your place was cooler than it was before, you wouldn't complain, would you?</p>

<p>Anyway, so Satan had missed out on all the broo-ha-ha with Moses and Jesus and all those people, so he had some catching up to do. He had to get some street cred! Couldn't let God have all that shit. I mean, shit. Satan was rolling bones with the Dinosaurs waaay before God came around to the idea. Not only that, but God had a book. A FUCKING BOOK. How cool is that shit?</p>

<p>So Satan was chillin and watching the Terminator with Al Gore and was all like "SKYNET HAS BECOME SELF AWARE" and Al Gore was all like "DUDE. Internet." But we still have quite a bit of history to cover before we get to that.</p>

<p>So Satan, being the hardcore bone roller that he is, rolled hella bones in his time, right? So everyone just assumed that he was dropping his old bones all up over the place all the time, right? But this dude Darwin was all "no. we came from monkies." and everyone assumed he smoked mad green. For good reason. And then everyone was fighting about whether we came from monkies or whether God made everyone and then everyone got all on the FSM wagon and so He did come down with His noodley appendages and did, in fact, smoke us up.</p>

<p>Joseph Smith, however, did way too much acid and was off his fucking rocker. Him and L Ron Hubbard. Especially Mr. Hubbard.</p>

<p>Anyway, back when the Taliban was in power, they prohibited any Afghan fields to be used to grow opium. But now that the taliban is out of power, Afghanistan produces approx. 97% of the world's opium. That really doesn't have to do with anything, but it makes you think.</p>

<p>So Satan was smoking some mad chronic with some multi-ethnic lesbinans, when he was like "we need to find a dank ass sub company and some skinny ass dude and photoshop him with some fat ass beer belly, and buy him some fucking size 1200 jeans and fucking bank that shit and we'll make mad coin." And that's where subway comes from. Which is where Jersey Mikes and Firehouse and Jimmy Johns and every other sub shop in your area came from. THAT SHIT IS REAL. SO YOU KNOW THIS IS THE TRUTH.</p>

<p>And I don't really feel like insulting anyone else right now, which is to say that I can't think of anyone else to insult right now. So. I'll work on this tomorrow.</p>
