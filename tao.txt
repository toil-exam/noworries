the tao of satan

1

the tao of satan is a no-thing
it doesn't
the tao of satan leads to no-where
it cannot be found

the tao of satan has no name
when called, never answers
the tao of satan is nondescript
when examined, yields contradictory results

meaning is artificial
arising from interaction
no man is an island
no island a man

i mean granted easter island has those stone statues
but that's neither here nor there

2

for good to been seen as personally beneficial
evil must be shown to be publicly detrimental

destruction requires creation
construction requires devastation
a frictionless exchange
save the loss of time

there'd be no giants
were everyone six foot eight
and no dwarves
if we were all two foot three

it's easy to demean those better off than you
but you're lying if you say wouldn't kill to win the lottery
it's easy to pity those less furtunate than you
but when was the last time you donated to charity?

words without actions are keys with no car
and let's not even get into tags, registration, lisence and insurance

3

increasing value of those in prolific positions
removes value from the less fortunate
increasing the price of goods
forces those who have little to have less

climbing the tallest mountain
seeing a larger one on the horizon
tit for tat
solutions creating problems
ad inifitum
edges ending in corners

neither start nor finish found
no matter the search

4

it is a racing circuit
predictable

i lost count of the laps years ago
the man over there claims to have an idea
but i doubt it's too accurate

what are the standings?
what, now? or then?
were they listed last lap?
can anyone give me a concise answer?

5

taking sides
implies preference
how can the tao of satan be on your side
when the tao of satan is on mine?

it is not important -- it has no value
you cannot sell something priceless
would you buy something worthless?

6

no words can describe it
not even "indescribable"

it has no use
but isn't useless

7

go to the edge of the universe
and send me a postcard
when i find the subatomic particle that can't be split
i'll be sure to take a snapshot

following a trail of breadcrumbs
seeking an edge piece to a spherical puzzle

the shortest distance between two points is a straight line
arriving at point b
finding yourself at point a again
triangulating again
there's point b!
traipsing over
finding point a

giving up
stumbling upon point c
point b ought to be here somewhere...
there!
rushing over
your heart drops as your realize

godsdamned point a

8

air and water are neccessities of life
yet tornados and hurricanes devastate

every snowflake unique
yet instantly recognizeable
like fingerprints
without the criminal databases

without reference
living one honest interaction at a time
even without blueprints
a house needs a foundation to be built

9

change is the nature of reality
don't expect it to stop

only you can control yourself
you only can control yourself
you can only control yourself
you can control only yourself
you can control yourself only

any vote counts equally

10

let's take a vacation in time
to when or where matters not
ones personal experience will never change
passports losing blank pages
one stamp at a time

if you were supposed to go back in time and change your life
you would have already met yourself
go back with last week's lottery numbers and win the jackpot
you could split the winnings with yourself
but people might start asking questions
you could kill yourself
or yourself might kill you
perhaps you could find your way back to now
but you'd still be broke

11

wine with no vessel
is a puddle

a nail with no hammer
isn't very useful

it takes two to tango

12

we all agree the sky is blue
but do we see the same blue?
we can agree a rose smells sweet
but could anyone recreate the scent?

the more we overstimulate
the more stimulation we require
the mind develops a tolerance to reality

a man with simple tastes is easy to please

13

the hierarchal ladder of structure is shaky
whether ascending or descending
you'll remain on the same rung until you move

whether your heart is full of hope or fear
the future is unwritten
remove the burden of apprehension
and your path becomes clear

success and failure are not so clear cut
goals may be accomplished through hard work
but remove bias and preconceived notions
and freely enjoy the moment at hand

the world works the way it works because that's the way the world works

14

you seek that which cannot be found!
you strain to hear that which never made a sound!
you grasp for something that was never there

it hasn't been since before this was
and won't be until this isn't
but this has always been
and it never was

it exists between the distinction of something and nothing

15

i've been told that someone once knew
but i don't know them
and the people i know don't know them
how can i be certain they knew?

if any of them really knew
wouldn't anyone who listened to them know?
and since no one seems to really know
how can i be certain anyone knows?

how can i be certain there is something to be known?

16

reality houses the body
the body houses the brain
the brain houses the mind
the mind houses the soul

the soul houses reality

experience filters through the layers
a change in one layer rippling outward

all things are interconnected

your actions create a very real impact on your life
everything that happens stays done
there is no escaping the inescapable

17

a true leader leads least but leads best
a light approach is preferred

laws make criminals
martyrs make tyrants

a true leader's success is contagious

18

distinction creates conflict
two sides of a coin never come up simultaneously

dynamic systems can never become static
and vice versa
analog can never truly be described in digital

the chance of acceptance
requires the chance of rejection

19

destroy order
and lose chaos

destory hope
and lose fear

destroy salvation
and lose damnation

boats would never sink
if we could figure out
how to make them from swiss cheese

20

the comatose live free from worry!
reject dogma and write your own
do not allow the will of another to brainwash you
do not allow the hate of another to overpower you

rise to the challenge!
prove yourself!

your actions alone decide your fate
you possess everything you need to succeed

rome wasn't built in a day!
hard work and dedication are a small price to pay

every moment lies at the intersection between
i know what just happened
and
what's going to happen next?

personal existence rests between
the person i am
and
the person i'm going to be

wouldn't a static existence be boring?

21

your keys are in the last place you look
once you find them, you stop looking

how do you find a no-thing?
stop looking

you want something until you get it
how strange it would be, desiring something you possess!

how do you possess a no-thing?
stop searching

22

perfection is imperfect!

it is difficult to straighten spaghetti

a ten gallon tank will never hold twenty gallons
but can easily hold five

birth guarantees death

a man who brags is seldom well-liked
no matter how good a job he does

it would be easier to stare at the sun
if it weren't so bright

a well liked man connects with everyone
no matter who they are

would a bottomless pit make a good well?
an endless length of rope might come in handy

23

when done right
it's easier than doing nothing

a tree isn't greedy
it uses the nutrients available
it makes the best of its surroundings
a tree isn't frugal

24

icarus flew high
and fell far

hate is like charcoal, burning red-hot
how long can you hold it?
scream at it to stop burning you
beg for it to cool down
threaten its family
try blackmail
you cannot convince an ember to be otherwise!

25

there was something perfect
long ago, a moment before time
complete! and whole

to call it "the divine" is to oversimplify
to call it otherwise is narrow minded

for a blink of an eye it stood tall
gathering itself
needing only that moment of respite
before giving itself up once again

everything that is
came from that which was

everything that will be
comes from that which is

prayers fall on deaf ears
recorded on an answering machine
that will crumble and decompose
before ever being checked

26

oppression is the source of uprising
an obelisk, begging to be toppled

a rigid tower is easily torn down
but a swaying bridge will weather many storms

travel a thousand miles
see a hundred sights
you'll see your home in every house
your family in every face

how unfammiliar!
but not strange

what's out of context?
this dichotomy!
from the inside everything looks fresh
from the outside you're looking new
how long before this feeling fades?

27

who wouldn't want to be a good person?

being a good person means
doing the right thing
and
helping those less fortunate
and
defeating evildoers

most people
do the easy thing
and
help themselves
and
turn a blind eye

a bad man
does what he must
and
is never helped
and
just tries to survive

28

recognize yourself
so that you may recognize others

do not hate your neighbor
for having a nicer car
do not hate your boss
for being above you
do not hate your enemy
for being different

do not demean your neighbor
for their yellow yard
do not demean a worker
for being below you
do not demean your enemy
for being different

if you are unhappy with your life
do not project your insecurities onto others
make a change in yourself
no one else will

29

you want to change the world?
be my guest!
apply yourself for an eaon
as soon as you turn your back
someone changes it
sometimes back to how it was
sometimes into something new

everything we do
are footprints in the sand

ignore the step you took
except to improve the step you take

30

religion
philosophy
science
government

nicknames for the tao of satan

seeking a greater understanding
seeking to improve
seeking answers

but yelling louder isn't helping
being right isn't working
knowing everything hasn't helped
being powerful hasn't worked

life's a bitch
and then you die
in the meantime
try not to be a dick

31

weapons are tools of violence
what other purpose do they serve?

every man woman and child
has the right to defend themselves
but having a more lethal weapon
simply attempting to one-up any would-be attacker
only leads to others acquiring more pernicious tools
in an attempt to thwart any would-be attacker
whether it's buying a handgun
when mace would do
or cooking up rockets and nuclear weapons
"because what if they have bigger ones?"

birthing a weapon
is digging graves
carrying a weapon
is fashioning coffins
using a weapon
is hammering in the last nail

32

the tao of satan is bottomless
no matter how far you stretch it
it can always be split again
if the tao weren't powerful
wouldn't it make sense

if i were the tallest man
and laws written in blood
how many ways
would you know where to begin?
stop!

WITH A THOUSAND FACES
TREMBLING IN THE DUST
THE JOURNEY TRAVELED
SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
make sense

33

"i hate you"
"i hate you because you're different"
"i hate you because you're not me"

"i hate that i can't change you"
"i hate that i'm filled with hate and you don't even notice"
"i hate that i'm the only one hating"

"i hate myself because now everyone thinks i'm a hater"
"i hate myself because i'm a hater"
"i hate myself"

34

all action is reaction

all data is metadata

satan's message
can never be pushy
only coercive
once heard
can never be unheard

35

satan has seen everything
and can be seen everywhere

satan has cooked every meal
but is tasted in every new dish

a value extrapolated
but never quantified

36

never make the first move
it leaves you open

never grow too tall
the scythe will find you first

never seek what you desire
give it away freely

allow those around you
to learn to fail

37

satan hasn't done anything in a while
but quite a few things are done in his name
quite a few things are attributed to him
"the devil made me do it!"
the epitome of an antagonist

in ancient mythology
the idea of a creator and revolter are not foreign
but just as many creators defeated
as many as revolted succeeded
and both revered the champion equally

satan is not
which side will win?
but rather
will a side win?
